# Price Monitoring Scraper Extension

## Project Abstract
_The extension will provide a way for the user to record items and monitor their prices. This will allow the user to watch items on e-commerce websites like Amazon or eBay. The extension will have a list and the user can add items to it by providing a name and a URL that contains pricing information about the item. User can choose to be notified of the price change when the price falls under a certain percentage. Other additions could be automatically scraping a website for a specific item and then report back items that matched certain keywords and prices. The user can then add these items to the list to monitor. The advantages of this is that it will be performed in the background without the user having to spend effort in scrolling through a bunch of pages or rechecking multiple pages for possible sales._
